## 🛠️ Configuration

Edit the **last cell** in the notebook:

```python
# Your details here:
category = '2'              # EB category: 1, 2, 3, or 4
country = 'row'             # india, china, mexico, philippines, or row
priority_date = '2025-11-25' # Your priority date
months_back = 60            # Months to analyze (default: 60 = 5 years)
```

| **Category** | `1` `2` `3` `4` | EB-2 visa → `'2'` |
| **Country** | `india` `china` `mexico` `philippines` `row` | Rest of World → `'row'` |

## ❓ FAQ

### "What's a Priority Date?"
The date USCIS received your green card petition (I-140). Once this date becomes "current," you can file for adjustment of status (I-485).

### "What does ROW mean?"
**Rest of World** — all countries except India, China, Mexico, and Philippines (which have separate queues).

### "Why 3 different predictions?"
Because visa movement isn't perfectly predictable. The 3 scenarios give you a realistic range:
- **6-month trend** = Most recent (could be short-term spike)
- **12-month trend** = Balanced view
- **24-month trend** = Most conservative

### "Can I trust this?"
The tool uses **official State Dept data**. Projections are based on historical trends, which are ~70-80% accurate. Always check the official visa bulletin monthly for surprises!

### "My country/category isn't working"
Currently supports EB-1 through EB-4 for these countries:
- India, China, Mexico, Philippines, ROW
